A Portland, OR local bartering app that is purely items (no exchange of $$).

By Grace Provost and Micheal Warren

Objective
===
In one week on a team of two people, create an app that displays:
  - Responsive web design using a combination of CSS Grid and Flexbox.
  - Semantic, accessible markup.
  - Component and router architecture.
  - Vanilla js, css, html
  - Webpack for development and production builds
  - Allows users to sign up and sign in, using Firebase authentication system.
  - Stores user data using:
    - Realtime Firebase Database
    - Firebase Cloud Storage for files and images
  - Protection in parts of the app from unauthorized access
  - Implement responsive image loading strategies using cloudinary
  - Apply the principles of Chapter 3 of Don't Make Me Think! to make body copy scan-friendly.
  - Subtle CSS animations could aid usability.

Steps Taken
===

We started with researching direct and indirect competitors to our idea. We used craigslist, offerup and letgo as examples. We created user personas and user stories to help guide our design choices. We created a UX strategy document. We sketched what the routes and subroutes of the app would look like, structured our components, and began building the html architecture. Each component was done one at a time. We started with user authentication, then item addition, then item display, etc. The items can be edited in real time after posting. The minimum required to post an item is one image and a title.

Reflection / Changes
===

This was a fast-paced, demanding experience creating a full-fledged application with only two people. Learning to work with firebase was exciting and challenging. The application is able to respond and update instantly due to firebase's live-updating features. This makes for a fun user experience with real-time bartering.

In the future, it would be great to create functionality that alerts users when they have changes to ongoing trades.
